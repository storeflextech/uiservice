                        <p>When you need it, you need it right then! The warehouses go with huge unutilized and unsold spaces when there are customers who are unable to find the right space for their immediate need. This is an unstructured market, with no defined rules and lacks agility. StoreFlex technologies knows the short-comings and has come up with solutions to remove these gaps by making data driven decisions on behalf of the customers, augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning automation.
                            This is the first true market place dedicated to the warehouse segment from industry insiders, connecting buyers and sellers directly in real time.
                            With a customer first mindset, our technology and customer care backbone gives delightful experience to both buyers and sellers of space.</p></div>
